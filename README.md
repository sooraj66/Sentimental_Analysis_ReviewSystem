# Sentimental_Analysis_ReviewSystem
# Overview
The main objective of the project is to perform sentiment analysis on text data to classify reviews as positive or negative.This project involves a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis, incorporating data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps.

# Purpose
The project aims to preprocess text data, extract features using TF-IDF representation, train a model for sentiment analysis, and evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, ROC curve, confusion matrix, and feature importances.

# Technologies used
The project utilizes various libraries and modules for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Some key terminologies used include:
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Seaborn for visualization
NLTK for natural language processing
Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks
Matplotlib for plotting

# Final Steps
The final steps involve transforming new reviews data, making predictions on sentiment using a trained model, and displaying the predictions for each review as positive or negative.
